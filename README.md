## Information
Amelia Ubben, Community Action Computing (CS150), March 24, 2025.

## Region and Reason for Selection
I chose Denver, Colorado because that is where I'm living after graduating. It's a really fast-growing city with lots of job opportunities, so I thought it would be interesting to look at.
## A Data
I selected an array of data sets from multiple sources. A handful of them showed the consumer price index change
over time of different goods. I picked ones that had a wide range of years and were relevant to an average consumer.
The others I chose provided information about median income. 
Data and article citations can be found in the dashboard under the learn tab.
I used Static csv data, all found the Assets folder. Titles: ("All_homes", "All_items", "Apparel", "Food_at_home", "Gasoline", "Median_income", "Medical_care", "Used_cars") 

## Strategies
I will be using blank space by using a webpage background that matches the graph background. 
I used simple colors, only red and blue to use to compare two value outputs. This helps reduce cognitive overload.
I was intentional about my axis labels and graph titles, as it is important with similar graphs to clearly label things.

## Scenarios or Stories w/ my dashboard
scenario 1: A student wondering if they will make enough money to be able to afford to live in Colorado

scenario 2: A working adult seeing what expense they could reduce to better afford living in Colorado

scenario 3: User wants to look at change in cost of goods to predict how inflation may impact certain necessities in this area

### A Note: An AI tool was used for assistance with some components
I used a few prompts input in Copilot for assistance with the implementation of the raw data tab, cost over time graph, and general errors along the way.
-Raw data tab: helped me to problem solve the values not displaying at first as well as the use of the DataTable function
-Cost over time graph: helped me put all the values onto one graph and to understand the check-box implementation
